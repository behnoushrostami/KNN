# KNN
A function that computes the pairwise distance between all points in x_train and x_test given a distance metric.
    :param x_train: training data set (n x d)
    :param x_test: test data set (m x d)
    :param metric: "euclidean": euclidean distance metric (L2 norm)
    :return distances: matrix of pairwise distances (m x n)
